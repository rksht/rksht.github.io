<p>In all this discussion, variables $n$ and $k$ will be positive integers.</p>
<p>A sequence $S \equiv S(n)$ (denoted as $S_n$) where $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is said to have a <em>finite</em> limit $a$ iff</p>
<p>$$
\forall d \in \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}, (\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, (\forall n \gt k, (|a - S_n| \lt d)))
$$</p>
<p>From an adversary game point of view, no matter how small you choose $d$ (without making it 0), you will find that the distance between $a$ and $S_n$ stays less than $d$ after a certain point.</p>
<p>There is no notion of continuity for sequences. Sequences are discrete functions after all.</p>
<h2 id="lim-s--infty-vs-non-existence">$\lim S = \infty$ vs. non existence</h2>
<p>$(\lim S = \infty)$ $\implies$ Not convergent</p>
<p>Limit equals infinity is special. It&rsquo;s a bit of abuse of terminology, imo. This is also called &ldquo;improper limit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p><strong>Non convergent seq</strong> $\Longleftrightarrow$ $(\lim_{n-&gt;\infty} S_n = \infty)$ $\vee$ **No limit**</p>
<p><del>Any sinusoidal function sampled at less than half the period - thus giving a discrete function, is an example of a sequence that <em>does not have a limit</em> and hence it&rsquo;s divergent. It&rsquo;s limit is obviously not $\infty$ either.</del></p>
<p>Then what is limit equals infinity?</p>
<p>In plain english, a sequence tends to infinity when the value of the sequence is unbounded <em>and</em> in a way &ldquo;blows up&rdquo;  - not the formal &ldquo;monotic function&rdquo; definition by the way so don&rsquo;t confuse with it. That sense is difficult to explain in english so a stricter mathematical definition will have to suffice.</p>
<p>The definition of $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty^+} S_n = \infty^+$</p>
<p>$$
\forall d \in \mathbb{R}^+, (\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, (\forall n &gt; k, (S_n &gt; d)))
$$</p>
<p>From an adversary game point of view, no matter how large you choose d, you will find that $S_n$ never goes below i.e. stays above $d$ after a certain point.</p>
<p>A sequence with limit equal to infinity is also a divergent sequence as it doesn&rsquo;t have a limit as per the definition.</p>
<p>Coming back to sinusoids, the sequence $S_n = \sin(n\pi/4)$ does not have a finite limit, nor is it&rsquo;s limit $\infty$. It&rsquo;s non convergent. English - the function keeps cycling up and down, but of course that&rsquo;s not enough for non convergence.</p>
<p>The function $sin(x)/x$, and it&rsquo;s discretized version (i.e. a sequence of samples) is an example of a non-monotonic function, that has a limit = $0$. It also &ldquo;cycles up and down&rdquo; but is convergent.</p>
<p>A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with uniform distribution in $[0 \ldots 1)$ is also a non convergent sequence.</p>
<p>The absolute value of the sequence $S_n = (-1)^n$ has limit of infinity (again, it&rsquo;s an improper limit, i.e. divergent nonetheless), but the sequence itself does not have limit equals infinity. The sequence is divergent. BTW, this sequence is same as $S_n = \sin(\pi/2 + n\pi)$.</p>
<p>Function function $n^2$ does not have a finite limit, and is divergent and has &ldquo;improper limit&rdquo; of $\infty$. It&rsquo;s monotonic.</p>
<p>The function $x \cdot sin(x)$ does not have a finite limit, and is divergent and has &ldquo;improper limit&rdquo; of $\infty$. It&rsquo;s not monotonic, but &ldquo;blows up&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="big-o">Big-O</h2>
<p>Most often in asymptotic analysis of algorithms, the functions assumed are continuous although in practial use the argument to the function is discrete since it denotes number of inputs ($= n$), a positive integer.</p>
<p>A function $f \equiv f(n)$ is in $O(g)$ where $g \equiv g(n)$, i.e. $f \in O(g)$ iff</p>
<p>$$
\exists k \geq 1, (\exists n', \forall n &gt; n', (f(n) \leq k \cdot g(n)))
$$</p>
<p>The definition looks similar to the definition of the limit of a sequence. Can we rephrase in terms of limit of sequence (discrete limit), especially since these functions are only applied to positive integers? Assume that $g$ converges, i.e. has a limit.</p>
<p>$$
\exists k \geq 1, (\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{k \cdot g(n)} \in [0 \ldots 1])
$$</p>
<p>Here the sequence of which the limit is computed is $S(n) = \frac{f(n)}{k \cdot g(n)}$</p>
<p>Write a somewhat formal proof?</p>

<p><a href="http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/donbyrd/Teach/Math/Zeno+Footraces+InfiniteSeries.pdf">http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/donbyrd/Teach/Math/Zeno+Footraces+InfiniteSeries.pdf</a></p>
<p>The proof says that the total time taken by Achilles to reach the tortoise <strong>is not greater than 11.1111&hellip; seconds</strong>. How do you deduce from that Achilles <strong>reaches</strong> the tortoise at 11.1111&hellip; seconds? Does this <em>prove</em> spacetime is discrete? Something something Planck length? Don&rsquo;t know.</p>
