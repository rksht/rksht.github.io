      <description>C/C++ coding convention Indentation Indent using 4 spaces. 2 spacess is too small, and using tabs makes it difficult to line stuff up using a mixture of spaces and tabs.
Structs/classes Make them capitalized
struct LikeThis { };  Local variables, and member variables Make them snake cased.
LikeThis like_this;  Function names Make them snake cased too
void my_cool_function(int first, int second) {}  Macros Make them SCREAMING! You should prefer enums, and inline functions, and use macros only when there is no other way or they reduce verbosity a lot.</description>

      <description>Using the inversion method.
The CDF is
$$ G(\theta, \phi) = \frac{\sin^2\theta}{2\pi} (\phi+\pi) $$
We got two random variables that we need to sample $\theta$ and $\phi$.
First, as per the technique, we compute $G_{max} ≡ G(\theta, \phi_{max})$ . Noting that $\phi_{max} = \pi$ we compute $G(\theta,\pi) = \sin^2\theta$.
Now, if we generate a canonical random variable $r_j$, let $r_j = G(\theta_j,\pi)$, where $\theta_j$ stands for the sampled value of $\theta$.</description>

      <description>Preliminary Differential solid angle = $dω = \sin{\theta} \space dθ \space dϕ$
A solid angle is an integral quantity. Multiple collections of directions can have the same solid angle measure.
 &amp;ldquo;Power&amp;rdquo; without any extra &amp;ldquo;per something&amp;rdquo; is not a super useful quantity.
Power entering or leaving a surface $\Phi$ is an integral quantity denoting the total power measured on the surface area of an object.
So we are indeed associating power with area.</description>

      <description>This is not inheritance.
type GitGudder interface { GitGud() } type BaseStruct struct { // whatever } func (b *BaseStruct) GitGud() { // meh } type MyStruct struct { BaseStruct number int }  This is not inheritance. Although MyStruct implements the GitGudder interface, the BaseStruct in MyStruct knows nothing about the other fields in MyStruct. So it truly is composition. The GitGud() method on BaseStruct takes a pointer to BaseStruct, not MyStruct.</description>

      <description>Some silly comments
  Terseness: Although it can be overdone, you can write terse yet readable code.
  Monads:
 Value producers with outgoing valves? Yes, &amp;ldquo;valves&amp;rdquo;. A type that implements a function called bind which should know how to pump values into a continuation? That&amp;rsquo;s about it    Monad transformers:
 A value producer that you get by connecting two or more value producers?    Do notation:</description>

      <title>Limit of a sequence (i.e. discrete limit)</title>
      <link>https://rksht.github.io/posts/limit_of_sequence/</link>

      <description>Limit of a sequence (i.e. discrete limit) In all this discussion, variables $n$ and $k$ will be positive integers.
A sequence $S \equiv S(n)$ (denoted as $S_n$) where $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is said to have a finite limit $a$ iff
$$ \forall d \in \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}, (\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, (\forall n \gt k, (|a - S_n| \lt d))) $$
From an adversary game point of view, no matter how small you choose $d$ (without making it 0), you will find that the distance between $a$ and $S_n$ stays less than $d$ after a certain point.</description>
